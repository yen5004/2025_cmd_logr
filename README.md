# Shell Command Logger Script
This script allows you to log all the shell commands you run in your terminal to a file, helping you keep track of your command history in a structured and persistent way. The logger will save your commands in daily log files within a **`~/log`** directory.

## Features:
* Log Shell Commands: Every command you execute in your terminal is logged to a file in the **`~/log`** directory.
* Automatic Setup: The script automatically configures your **`.bashrc`** and **`.zshrc`** files to enable logging each time you open a terminal session.
* Avoid Infinite Loops: The script is designed to avoid infinite loops when logging, preventing it from logging the logging process itself.
* Customizable: You can set your username, and the script adapts to your terminal environment.


## How It Works:
1. Directory Setup:
When you run the script, it first ensures that a **`~/log`** directory exists. This directory is where all the log files will be saved.

2. Updating Shell Configuration Files:
The script modifies both **`.bashrc`** and **`.zshrc`** (for Bash and Zsh users) to include commands for logging every shell session:

  - RPROMPT: It sets a custom right prompt in the terminal to display the current date and time.

  - Script Command: It adds a conditional check that runs the **`script`** command to log all terminal output to a daily log file. The log files are named based on the current date (e.g., **`2025-01-29_shell.log`**).

3. Preventing Recursive Logging:
A key feature of this script is its ability to avoid logging the log file itself, which would cause an infinite loop:

  - The script checks the current process **`(ps -ocommand= -p $$)`** to ensure that it is not already running within a script session.
  - It also checks the current working directory to ensure that the script doesnâ€™t run while inside the **`~/log`** directory, avoiding logging the logs.

4. User Information:
The script prompts you to input your username, which is then saved to the shell configuration files. It displays your username and system IP address when the terminal starts.

## Installation:
To install the script, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```
2. Give the correct permissions:
```
sudo chmod 777 install_cmd_log.sh
```
3. Run the installation script:
```
bash install_cmd_log.sh
```
Alternate command:
```
./install_cmd_log.sh
```

The script will:

- Ask for your username.
- Modify your .bashrc and .zshrc to set up the command logging.
Create a **`~/log`** directory where the logs will be stored.

3. Restart your terminal to apply the changes. From then on, your terminal sessions will be logged to the **`~/log`** directory.

## Usage:
- Every time you start a new terminal session, the script will log the commands you enter to a daily log file in the **`~/log`** directory.
- The log file will include a timestamp for each command and any output from the command.
 -You can review your command history by inspecting the log files in the **`~/log`** directory.

## Logs Directory:
Your logs will be stored in **`~/log/`**, and each log file is named by the current date (e.g., **`2025-01-29_shell.log`**). This ensures that logs are stored separately for each day.

## Customization:
- Username: The script asks for your username and stores it in the **`.bashrc`** and **`.zshrc`** files.
- Log File Location: The logs are saved to **`~/log/`**, but you can modify this if needed by editing the script.
- Terminal Prompts: You can modify the RPROMPT to change the way the date and time appear in your terminal prompt.

Including:
- Output location of the log file and name
- Your User Name
- IP address info
- Instructions to use exit to stop the logging script
- Date/Time stamp information on the far right of the terminal

# Things to know
* The script looks to make a log folder under you home direcotry typically `~/log`, you can find your logs here
* The script sometimes loops if you view the log file your currently writing to, measures have been employed to prevent this, but may need to use the cmd `exit` to view the log file.
* The script will run in each instance of terminal
* The no frills orginal code can be found here:
